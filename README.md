# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Welcome to my RNN Learning Repository! 
This repo contains my journey into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including various implementations, experiments, and insights.  

## Overview  
RNNs are a type of neural network designed for sequential data, making them powerful for tasks like natural language processing (NLP), time-series forecasting, and speech recognition. 

In this repository, I will explore:  
- Fundamentals of RNNs 🏗️  
- Hands-on implementation using TensorFlow/Keras 🔧  
- Experimentation with datasets 📊  
- Hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation 📈  
- Comparisons with LSTMs and GRUs 🔄
